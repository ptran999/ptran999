I am currently a Bellevue University student who is majoring in Web Development. I found my true passion in programming. I have been using a lot of clunky and counter-intuitive software, and my curiosity about why other programs work makes me want to dive deep into the field. I enjoy coding so far. I also love the combination of creative and logical problem-solving skills that I get when writing code. And I love how thereâ€™s always more to learn! I am a fast learner and highly self-motivated.
I am looking forward to working with you. Shoot me an email if you are interested. I am free for coffee.
